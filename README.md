# Regression-Based Siamese Network for Eye Opening Rate Prediction

This project implements a regression-based Siamese Network to predict the eye-opening rate from images. The network utilizes pairs of eye images, comparing a 'normal' image against various 'diagonal' (altered) images, to estimate how open the eyes are on a scale from 0 to 1. It's particularly useful in applications where understanding the state of the eyes is crucial, such as in driver drowsiness detection systems.

## Project Structure

- `augmentation_images/`: Directory containing the training and validation image sets.
- `validation_data/`: Directory containing additional images for validation.
- `best_model.pth`: The saved model weights after training.
- `siamese_network.py`: Main script for defining and training the Siamese Network model.
- `dataset.py`: Script for data loading and preprocessing.
- `loss.py`: Definition of the ModifiedContrastiveLoss used for training the network.
- `utils.py`: Miscellaneous utility functions used across the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- torchvision 0.8 or higher
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset by placing your normal and diagonal images in the `augmentation_images/` directory.
2. Run the `siamese_network.py` script to train the model:

```bash
python siamese_network.py

bash
Copy code
python siamese_network.py
After training, the best model will be saved as best_model.pth.

For evaluating the model on the validation set, you can modify and use the evaluation code section in siamese_network.py.

Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the project:

Data Path: Change data_dir and normal_image_path in the siamese_network.py script to point to your dataset directories.
Hyperparameters: Modify learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs as needed in the training section of the script.
Network Architecture: Adjust the Siamese Network architecture in siamese_network.py according to your requirements.
